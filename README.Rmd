PartRidge allows the user to extract and visualize partial residuals from a ridge regression model fit with glmnet.

## Installation

You can install the development version of PartRidge from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("justin-kulchycki/PartRidge")

## Obtaining partial residuals

Examining partial residuals provides insight into the effects of individual predictor variables on the target variable.
